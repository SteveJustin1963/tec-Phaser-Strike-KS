# tec-Phaser-Strike-KS

## Acknowledgement

Ken Stone; "This was a "child" of the TEC-1. The first version was made by modifying my blue prototype.
It was meant to be a version of "phaser strike", the real life laser tag game. It was to be superior to the version we were playing, but someone else came out with an even better one, so the project was dropped. There were three PCBs made, two of which were assembled, and rather annoyingly none of which I can find. I may have tossed them out. I even have the assembly language as a text file."

SJ; "Wow this is amazing ! Am sure our Jedi group would love to acknowledge and praise your effort, help bring this back to life; make the boards, load your code and defend the Rebel Alliance."
